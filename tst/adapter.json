Fascinated by the positive impacts of mindfulness meditation and yoga on health and well-being, he founded the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center where over 20, 000 people have since benefited from the seminal 8 week MBSR course.<\/p><p>What is MBSR? MBSR uses meditation, mindful movement and inquiry as a way of training people to relate differently to stresses in their lives. It was originally developed for patients in chronic pain, and for patients undergoing intensive treatments for cancer, AIDS and other serious illnesses, but has since expanded and been incorporated into the daily lives of thousands of people whether they are dealing with the serious stress of illness or simply the day to day pressures and anxieties of modern life.<\/p><p>Research over the past 32 years indicates that a majority of the people who complete this program report a greater ability to cope more effectively with short and long term stressful situations; an increased ability to relax; lasting decreases in physical and psychological symptoms; reduction in pain levels and enhanced ability to cope with chronic pain; and, most importantly, a greater energy and enthusiasm for life.<\/p><p>What you will receive and learn in the course:<br\/>&bull; Guided instruction in several meditation and mindful movement practices<br\/>&bull; Practical skills to improve your ability to handle stressful situations and conversations with greater ease<br\/>&bull; Gentle full body conditioning exercises to strengthen your body and release muscular tension<br\/>&bull; To become increasingly aware of the interplay of mind and body in health and illness, to improve resilience<\/p><p>Jon Aaron is a teacher at the New York Insight Meditation Center. He has given workshops and classes for the New York Open Center, the NYU Medical School, the Department of Psychology at Einstein College of Medicine, the Beth Israel Medical Center and for the 92nd St Y. Jon trained in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction at the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, where he continues advanced training and supervision for experienced teachers. He continues his studies in Buddhist meditation in the Theravada tradition with his primary teacher Matthew Flickstein and has also completed the Integrated Study and Practice Program, at the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies. He recently completed the Foundations in Buddhist Contemplative Care program, with the New York Zen Center for Contemplative Care, and he is now currently training in Somatic ExperiencingTM.<\/p><p>\"Jon is an excellent teacher of MBSR. It has had a major positive impact on my lifestyle. He has a calming voice and approach to introducing a significant lifestyle change. He seasons the class with a number of different approaches that allow him to touch class members with different perspectives on the practice. He anticipates and introduces issues effectively and is able to handle and meld class members into a cohesive group.\"<br\/>-John Ziegler, Investment Banker<\/p><p>\"I am a yoga teacher who has had the fortune to take 2 workshops with Jon. It was great to witness the skill and compassion, not to mention humor, with which Jon worked with a wide variety of people, helping us all to discover and deepen our experience of meditation.<br\/>I especially enjoyed the times he would bring in quotes from various poets and artists that help illustrate aspects of the meditation experience. I would then scurry back to the texts and use them to inspire me. Looking forward to the next workshop.\"<br\/>-Kevin Ryder, yoga teacher<\/p><p>\"In the Spring of 2011 I enrolled in a &ldquo;Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction&rdquo; course taught by Jon Aaron. Familiar with the benefits of mindfulness meditation through its popularization in the media, I had no personal experience of meditation and sought an arena in which to explore an enduring way to cope with stress and anxiety. I was fortunate to find a skillful, knowledgeable and thoughtful teacher in Jon Aaron. With compassion and patience, Jon led our group through the eight-week-long transformative course, helping each one of us to cultivate and develop a meditation practice by which to examine the nature of mind. Jon guided us through practical stress-relieving exercises that awakened a greater sense of body-awareness. I am appreciative of Jon&rsquo;s straightforward and considerate manner. Most of all, I am grateful for Jon&rsquo;s excellent guidance as a teacher, enabling me to develop a consistent meditation practice that has ultimately improved my well-being and happiness.\" &ndash;Anna Grossman<\/p><\/div>"},
